### Hello there!
- I'm always trying to make things easier/better/more organized when it comes to cybersecurity/pentesting/ethical hacking!
- At [**Cybersecurity Resources**](https://github.com/Kothmun/Cybersecurity_Resources) you'll find a curated and updated list of cybersecurity resources!
- At [**Pentesting 101**](https://github.com/Kothmun/Pentesting_101) you'll find (Soon!) pentesting techniques, tools and procedures!
- At [**my Medium blog**](https://kothmun.medium.com/) you'll find my CTFs writeups (HTB, THM)!

> If you find any of this useful, and feel like supporting my work, feel free to buy me a coffee below ;)
