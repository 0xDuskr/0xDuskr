### Hello there!
- I'm trying to make things easier/better/more organized when it comes to cybersecurity/pentesting/ethical hacking!
- At [**Cybersecurity Resources**](https://github.com/Kothmun/Cybersecurity_Resources) you'll find tools, techniques, blogs... basically everything related to cybersecurity (offensive and defensive).
- I'm also working on the repository [**Pentesting 101**](https://github.com/Kothmun/Pentesting_101), with Pentesting/Hacking procedures, techniques and tools, to make it easier/quicker to perform a pentest or a CTF.
- I'm posting CTFs writeups (HTB, THM) at [**my Medium blog**](https://kothmun.medium.com/).

> If you find any of this useful, and feel like supporting my work, feel free to buy me a coffee below ;)
